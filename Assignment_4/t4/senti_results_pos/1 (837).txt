in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic  100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to  10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . 	in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success - the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic  100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to  10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .	3	-3	 in[0] every[0] respect[2] the[0] re[0] release[0] of[0] the[0] little[0] mermaid[0] appears[0] to[0] be[0] a[0] success[2] the[0] film's[0] 1997[0] grosses[-1] have[0] pushed[0] its[0] cumulative[0] domestic[0] gross[-1] over[0] the[0] magic[0] 100[0] million[0] mark[0] the[0] little[0] mermaid[0] proved[0] to[0] have[0] remarkably[0] strong[0] drawing[0] power[0] for[0] a[0] film[0] initially[0] released[0] only[0] eight[0] years[0] ago[0] and[0] in[0] many[0] homes[0] on[0] video[0] pulling[0] in[0] close[0] to[0] 10[0] million[0] in[0] its[0] opening[0] weekend[0] and[0] although[0] nobody[0] could[0] possibly[0] expect[0] the[0] little[0] mermaid[0] to[0] possibly[0] defeat[0] the[0] aggressively[-2] marketed[0] anastasia[0] in[0] head[0] to[0] head[0] competition[0] it[0] siphoned[0] enough[0] from[0] the[0] fox[0] film's[0] opening[0] weekend[0] totals[0] to[0] keep[0] anastasia[0] [[Sentence=-3,3=word max, 1-5]][[[3,-3 max of sentences]]]
